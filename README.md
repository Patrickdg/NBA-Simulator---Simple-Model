# NBA Simulator (Simple Model) - Exploratory Analysis & Multivariable Regression Project
### Author: Patrick de Guzman
### Primary Data Source: [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)

## Synopsis
Data on the National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons from the Basketball Reference website was compiled, cleaned, and merged to create a final dataset of the following variables:  
- Team per game statistics (such as points per game, assists per game, etc.)  
- Opponent Team per game statistics (same as above but for opponent teams)  
- Advanced statistics (higher-level stats such as margin-of-victory, strength of schedule, etc.)  

From this compiled data, exploratory data analysis was performed in an attempt to discover the likely traits of 'winning' teams. For the purposes of this project, 'winning' teams are those that qualify for the NBA playoffs and/or win the NBA championships within a given year. 
Trends within the league were also explored, and features within the dataset were identified to correlate with a team's success rate (i.e., their Win/Loss percentages in the regular season). 

The following are included in the repository:
